## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Acescore Product Inventory is a React + Redux Toolkit application that manages an inventory of products with full CRUD capabilities. The app interfaces with a mock API (Fakestore API) to fetch, add, edit, and delete products, while providing a smooth user experience.

---

## âœ¨ Key Features

- **API Integration**  
  Interacts with the mock API to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. Supports loading and error states.

- **Product Listing**  
  Displays products with their image, name, price, and stock status in a responsive grid layout.

- **Add / Edit Products**  
  Use a form (embedded in a clean modal UI) to add new products or update existing ones.

- **Delete Products**  
  Remove products cleanly with confirmation and state updates.

- **Search & Filter**  
  Filter products by name and category using intuitive search and dropdown controls.

- **Redux Architecture**  
  Built with Redux Toolkitâ€”including slices, async thunks, and selectors.

- **State Persistence (Bonus)**  
  Inventory state persists in `localStorage`, making product data available even after page refreshes.

- **Enhanced UI**  
  Leveraged Bootstrap for responsive design, including form styling, grid layout, and modals.
